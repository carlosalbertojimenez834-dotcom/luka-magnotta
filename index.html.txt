            <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-300">Montreal, 2012.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-green-100">
                A package arrived at the office of Canada’s Conservative Party.
                Inside it: a human hand.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-green-100">
                A few hours later, another package was intercepted at an elementary school—this time, it contained a foot.
            </p>
            <p class="text-green-100 italic">
                What seemed like the beginning of an organized crime story was, in reality, the final chapter of a deeply disturbed mind…
                and the climax of a global manhunt that started with something no one took seriously.

            <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-300">Everything began on the internet.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-green-100">
                In 2010, a video surfaced in a dark corner of the web.
                It showed a skinny young man with pale, attractive features, gently petting two kittens…
                and then… sealing them inside a vacuum bag and suffocating them.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-green-100">
                No music.
                No face.
                Just a disturbing image that went viral in the darkest forums online.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-green-100">
                The police didn’t prioritize it. But a group of anonymous internet users did.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-green-100">
                They banded together from different parts of the world to find him.
                They analyzed every detail: the wall outlet, the blanket, the brand of cigarettes.
                All to identify the man who called himself “1lunatic1icepick.”
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-green-100">
                Two years of digital investigation followed.
                He toyed with them—leaving clues, creating fake profiles, even spreading rumors about himself on Wikipedia and forums, as if building his own myth.
            </p>
            <p class="text-green-100 italic">
                But what no one imagined was that his obsession wasn’t with cats…
                It was with attention.
                And he was about to cross the line.

            <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-300">On May 25, 2012, a new video appeared.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-green-100">
                This time, it wasn’t cats.
                It was a human being.
                A young Chinese student named Jun Lin, tied to a bed.
                And what happened in that video is simply indescribable.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-green-100">
                It was filmed with a fixed camera.
                Magnotta murdered him brutally.
                He used an ice pick. Dismembered the body.
                And then… mailed pieces of the corpse to schools, political parties, and media outlets.
            </p>
            <p class="text-green-100 italic">
                He did it for fame.
                Because he wanted the world to talk about him.
                And he succeeded.

            <p class="mb-4 text-green-100">
                Magnotta had fled.
                He passed through France, then Germany, using fake identities—until he was found in an internet café in Berlin.
                Why was he caught?
                He was reading news about himself.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-green-100">
                He was extradited to Canada, tried in Montreal, and sentenced to life in prison.
            </p>
            <p class="text-green-100 italic">
                During the trial, he showed zero remorse.
                He claimed to suffer from mental illness, but the jury didn’t believe him.
                To them—and to the entire country—Luka Magnotta was something even worse:
                A narcissistic killer, willing to do anything for fame.
